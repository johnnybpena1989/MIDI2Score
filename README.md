# MIDI2Score
MIDI2SCORE is a Python script that allows you to transcribe multi-track MIDI files into properly scored sheet music. The script uses the music21 library to parse MIDI files and extract individual tracks, notes, and chords. Each track is then scored based on the detected instruments and displayed in sheet music format.
